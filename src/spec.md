# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Enable users to exit chats and navigate between different chat boxes.

**Planned changes:**
- Add close/exit button to chat interface to return to chat selection view
- Implement navigation system to switch between multiple chat conversations
- Update ChatSidebar to display all available chat boxes with selection functionality
- Ensure each chat box maintains its own conversation history
- Add visual indication for the currently active chat

**User-visible outcome:** Users can exit the current chat, view a list of all chat sessions, and switch between different chat boxes while maintaining separate conversation histories for each.
