# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add a Teacher Mode toggle to the Math Problem Solver that provides enhanced, pedagogical explanations of mathematical concepts and solution steps.

**Planned changes:**
- Add a "Teacher Mode" toggle control in the MathProblemSolver component
- When Teacher Mode is enabled, enhance solution explanations to use clear, pedagogical language that explains why each step is performed
- Provide contextual explanations for mathematical concepts (exponents, logarithms, trigonometry) in accessible, everyday language
- Ensure explanations are appropriate for the selected grade level

**User-visible outcome:** Users can enable Teacher Mode to receive step-by-step solutions with educational explanations that clarify mathematical concepts and reasoning, making it easier for students to understand not just what to do, but why each step matters.
