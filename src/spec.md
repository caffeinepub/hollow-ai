# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Create a standalone, self-contained HTML demo page for Neroxa AI that works without external dependencies or build processes.

**Planned changes:**
- Generate a single HTML file with inline CSS and JavaScript
- Include proper HTML5 document structure with meta tags
- Create interactive demo sections showcasing core features (chat, math solver, media generation, translation, music, art, code generation, games)
- Maintain dark theme aesthetic consistent with existing design

**User-visible outcome:** Users can open a single HTML file directly in their browser to explore a fully functional demo of Neroxa AI's features without requiring installation, build processes, or internet connectivity.
