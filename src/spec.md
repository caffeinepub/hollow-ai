# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Set the math problem solver as the default landing page when users open the application.

**Planned changes:**
- Configure the default route in App.tsx to navigate directly to /math instead of the current landing page

**User-visible outcome:** Users will immediately see the math problem solver when they open the application, without needing to navigate to it.
