# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Make Pro subscription free for the owner account while keeping it $20 for all other users.

**Planned changes:**
- Grant automatic Pro access to the owner's Internet Identity without payment
- Configure $20 USD payment requirement for all non-owner accounts
- Hide Pro upgrade UI elements for the owner account
- Display "$20 to upgrade" messaging in ProFeaturesModal for regular users

**User-visible outcome:** The owner will have immediate Pro access upon login with no payment required, while other users will see a $20 upgrade option to access Pro features.
