# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add a new Scripter component with an AI chat interface where users can describe scripts they want generated.

**Planned changes:**
- Create a new Scripter component with a chat-style interface for script generation requests
- Add a "Scripter" tab to the main navigation alongside existing tabs
- Implement simulated AI script generation that displays formatted code responses in the chat history
- Follow existing dark theme and component patterns from TranslatorChat and ArtCanvas

**User-visible outcome:** Users can click a new "Scripter" tab, describe the script they want in a chat interface, and receive AI-generated code responses displayed in a conversation format.
