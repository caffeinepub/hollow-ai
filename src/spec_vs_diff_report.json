  "summary": "The diff implements a Pro subscription system with owner exemption and $20 pricing for regular users. Backend logic grants free Pro access to admin/owner accounts, and the frontend UI conditionally displays upgrade options and Pro features based on ownership status. The implementation aligns well with all four requirements.",
