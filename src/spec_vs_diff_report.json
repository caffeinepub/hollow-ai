  "summary": "The diff partially implements the BuildRequest. REQ-1 (logo replacement) is fully implemented in Header.tsx with the correct image path and responsive sizing. REQ-2 (branding updates) is only partially implemented - the Header component shows 'neroxa ai' branding, but there is no evidence of updates to application title, meta tags, or PWA manifest as required by the acceptance criteria.",

      "reason": "No changes shown to frontend/index.html meta tags or title. The file is listed as modified in frontend-file-summaries.txt but the actual diff content is not provided, so cannot confirm if title/meta tags were updated from 'Vantior AI' to 'Neroxa AI'.",
