REQ-2 (navigation between chat boxes) is implemented through ChatPage routing with sessionId parameters and a welcome screen when no session is selected. REQ-3 (ChatSidebar display and selection) is implemented with the sidebar showing sessions and navigation handlers. All acceptance criteria appear to be met based on the diff evidence.",
