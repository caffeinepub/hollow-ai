  "summary": "The diff successfully implements all three requirements: a game selection interface with Flappy Bird and other games (REQ-1), a fully playable Flappy Bird implementation with physics, obstacles, scoring, and game over detection (REQ-2), and integration into the GamePlayer component with high score tracking (REQ-3). All acceptance criteria appear to be met based on the code evidence.",

      "reason": "BuildRequest specifies a game play button that opens a game selection interface showing available games. The implementation adds an intermediate modal with three choices, where 'Play Built-in Games' leads to the requested game selector. This adds navigation complexity not requested in the requirements.",
