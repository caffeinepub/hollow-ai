  "summary": "The diff shows only backend changes (main.mo) and project_state.json updates. No frontend chat implementation is present. All chat-related requirements (REQ-1, REQ-2, REQ-3) are completely missing from the implementation.",

      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Restore the chat functionality with AI-powered responses using the existing useChatSessions hook pattern",
      "reason": "No frontend chat components, hooks, or AI response logic implemented. The diff only contains backend game/profile management code with no chat-related functionality.",

      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Ensure the ChatPage component correctly integrates ChatSidebar and ChatView with session management and navigation",
      "reason": "No ChatPage, ChatSidebar, or ChatView components are present in the diff. No session management or navigation logic for chat.",

      "requirement": "Verify the chat route (/chat) is properly configured in the TanStack Router setup and accessible from the main navigation",

      "id": "REQ-4",
      "requirement": "Fix any deployment issues that caused the previous version 46 build to fail, ensuring successful compilation and network deployment",
      "reason": "While backend code appears syntactically valid, no evidence of frontend chat implementation means the build cannot satisfy the BuildRequest. No deployment configuration or build fixes are visible in the diff.",
