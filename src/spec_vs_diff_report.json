  "summary": "The diff implements all four requirements with a Dictionary tab, backend word storage, search interface, and Web Speech API pronunciation. However, the backend contains no dictionary data (empty wordMap), falling short of the 250,000+ words requirement.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Backend stores a comprehensive dictionary dataset with 250,000+ words",
      "reason": "The backend wordMap is initialized as empty (Map.empty<Text, Word>()) with no dictionary data loading or pre-population. The migration also creates an empty wordMap. Without 250,000+ words loaded, the backend requirement is not met.",
